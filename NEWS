0.2.0 (2015-06-01)
* Reworked the Volkov distribution for performance.
* Reworked density, quantile and distribution functions for more consistent behaviour, 
error handling and large performance gains.
* Added some missing functions for mzsm, poig and poix families.
* New function *updatesad* to update a fitsad with better fit from profile.
* *radpred* now uses exact solutions for extreme data points.

* Removed trueLL method to an experimental branch
* Improved grammar and clearer text in some manual pages and vignette.
* Improved starting values for several distributions.
* Replaced table(cut(x)) for hist for improved performance.
* octav and rad classes now have validation functions and are more consistent.
* More informative calls in *show* and *summary*.
* Reduced code redundancy and improved readability.
* Changed some "Depends" and "Imports" to make the package more light-weight, but still reliable
